 📖 User Stories

Authentication 
- When I sign up, I want to supply my name, username, age and country so that I can create an account and start tracking habits. 
- When I return, I want to log in with my username and password so that my existing habit data loads. 
- If I enter the wrong credentials, I need an error message so I know the login failed. 

 
- After login, I want to see a friendly greeting that includes my name so I know I’m in the right account. 
- I’d like today’s progress for each habit shown on the main screen so I can check my status at a glance. 
- I also want a small “Completed” area listing habits I’ve already finished today.

 Navigation / Menu 
- I need a menu that lets me jump to Profile, Habits, Reports and Sign-out so I can reach every part of the app quickly. 
- From the menu, I want direct access to the Habits page to add or adjust habits. 
- I want a Sign-out option in that same menu so I can log off securely.

 Profile 
- I want to view the personal details (name, username, age, country) I gave at registration. 
- I should be able to edit those details whenever they change. 
- After saving changes, I want them reflected everywhere in the app—especially the greeting at the top.

 Habits Page 
- I want to add new habits from a configuration screen so my routine can evolve over time. 
- I’d like the ability to delete any habit that’s no longer relevant. 
- Assigning custom colors to habits would help me tell them apart quickly.

 Reports 
- I need a weekly summary showing how consistently I completed each habit. 
- A simple chart for finished habits per day helps me spot trends. 
- The report should include both completed and missed entries so I get the full picture.

 Notifications 
- I want a master switch to turn all habit reminders on or off. 
- I’d like to choose which habits should generate reminders. 
- For active reminders, I want three preset time windows—morning, afternoon, evening—so nudges arrive when they’re most helpful.
